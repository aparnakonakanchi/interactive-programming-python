Interactive Programming in Python - mini-projects
=================================================

["Interactive Programming in Python"](https://class.coursera.org/interactivepython-003/class) is one of the best courses on Coursera, and one of the best Python courses. This course uses an interesting way to get you to love Python: videogames. You will slowly work your way up the "Python ladder" by implementing one small project each week, consisting of a videogame. Whether is Black-Jack or Memory or Pong, it's a fun way to learn a new programming language. The most interesting part is that you can actually code your python project online, using [CodeSkulptor](http://www.codeskulptor.org), an online Python development tool created by one of the teachers on this course, Scott Rixner.

These are the mini-projects I developed during the course.

Disclaimer:
-------
These are not here for you to copy. These are here for your reference. I strongly encourage you to take this course and work on these on your own. They're especially aimed at the beginners in Python.

Prerequisites:
--------
* [Python 2.7](http://python.org/download/releases/2.7.6/) (they'll probably work in Python 3, but they need a bit of adjusting)
* [SimpleGUITk](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/SimpleGUITk) library - the course uses a custom library called Simplegui, but that library is only available in [CodeSkulptor](http://www.codeskulptor.org)
* [SimpleGUICS2Pygame](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/SimpleGUICS2Pygame) - an alternative to SimpleGUITk; used in week 8 because SimpleGUITk on Linux has some problems with loading sound files from URLs

Projects description:
---------

* Week 1: Rock, paper, scissors, lizzard, Spock - a gentle introduction to python and conditionals
* Week 2: Guess the number - introduces the "frame", input fields and events
* Week 3: Stopwatch - introduces the timer and the canvas, and string manipulation
* Week 4: Pong - who doesn't love Pong? Introduces drawings to canvas and collisions. Also, introduces a bit the concept of lists and touples
* Week 5: Memory - nice card game; teaches you how to draw images on the canvas
* Week 6: Black jack - you know what it is
* Week 7: Spaceship - things get serious. You'll learn about movement, friction, sprite animation
* Week 8: Rice-rocks - the final projects is an adaptation of a game called [Asteroids](http://www.play.vg/games/4-Asteroids.html).
